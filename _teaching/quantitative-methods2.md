This course provides students with the knowledge that they will need to attain an entry-level research analyst position in the international development space. Most quantitative methods courses that are the second in a sequence for Master's degrees in international affairs and public policy focus mostly on causality/internal validity. By contrast, in this course we complement a focus on causality with an all equal focus on external validity. That secondary focus on external validity is crucial: students will need to be able to use the tools that they learn in this course to answer policy-related questions in their future jobs.

The course begins with an introduction to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), because we need to learn to draw our assumptions before we draw our conclusions. Then, the course examines selection bias and how to correct for it in experiments. Next, we learn about instrumental variable models and standard natural experiments. In the second part of the course, we examine panel data regression, multilevel models, difference-in-differences, and matching. In the final part of the course, students learn about synthetic control and counterfactual estimators, regression discontinuity designs, and geomapping and spatial regression. The final class also covers ordered outcomes and count models. [[Syllabus]](/files/Denly_Syllabus_QuantMethods2.pdf)
