This course is the first semester of a Research Practicum program that attempts to provide undergraduates with a fairly comprehensive introduction to the research process in the social sciences. Classroom instruction covers arguments, concepts, measures, causality,
and basic statistics. Given that knowledge of statistical software, text editors, reference management software, and mapping software is increasingly helpful for success in the social sciences, the course will also provide training in Stata, R, LaTeX, Mendeley, Excel, and
ArcGIS. At the end of the first semester, students will hand-in their own well-developed Research Proposals in lieu of a final exam. [[Syllabus]](/files/Denly_Syllabus_Practicum_Sem1.pdf) [[Latest Evaluation]]((/files/Fall_2019_Practicum_Eval.pdf)
