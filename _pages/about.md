Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor at Texas A&M's Bush School of Government and Public Service and Executive Director of the [Lab for Economic Development Research (LEDR)](https://bush.tamu.edu/mosbacher/ledr/). Substantively, my [research](https://mikedenly.com/research/) focuses on corruption, foreign aid, natural resources, and other topics relating to the political economy of development. Methodologically, my second research agenda centers on external validity and how to make credible causal inferences. My work appears in the *Annual Review of Political Science* and *Journal of Conflict Resolution*.

Outside of academia, I have worked and/or consulted for the US State Department, the European Commission, the World Bank, USAID, and Inter-American Development Bank. Most of my recent work with these institutions concerns governance, anti-corruption, and natural resources.
