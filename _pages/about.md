Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Government at the University of Texas at Austin, and I also serve as [Governance Team](http://www.ipdutexas.org/governance.html) Leader at Innovations for Peace and Development. My substantive [research](https://mikedenly.com/research/) focuses on the political economy of development, with an emphasis on corruption, natural resources, and foreign aid. I also have a separate methodological research agenda, focusing on external validity. At UT Austin, I [teach](https://mikedenly.com/teaching/) a two-semester Research Practicum as well as a separate Data Science course.

Prior to joining UT Austin, I worked for the US State Department, the European Commission, and the World Bank. Since starting my Ph.D., I have consulted extensively for the World Bank and USAID on governance and anti-corruption issues.
