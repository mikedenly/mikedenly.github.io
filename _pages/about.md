# About Me

Welcome! I recently obtained my Ph.D. in Government at the University of Texas at Austin, where I also served as Research Fellow at the Innovations for Peace and Development lab. In fall 2022, I will join the Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse as a postdoctoral Research Fellow.

My substantive [research](https://mikedenly.com/research/) focuses on the political economy of development, with an emphasis on corruption, foreign aid, and natural resources. I also have a separate methodological research agenda that centers on external validity. My work appears in the *Annual Review of Political Science* and *Journal of Conflict Resolution*.

Outside of academia, I have worked and/or consulted for the US State Department, the European Commission, the World Bank, USAID, and Inter-American Development Bank. Most of my recent work with these institutions concerns governance, anti-corruption, and natural resources.
