<p style="font-size: 12pt; width: 100%; text-align: left;">Can foreign aid succeed in countries with weak institutions? Conventional wisdom suggests that it cannot because institutional problems are intractable, aid is fungible, and most aid is political and thus inefficient. To provide evidence to the contrary, I individually coded all 3,663 World Bank investment projects approved from the years 2001-2016 for their use of context-specific, project-level Governance and Anti-Corruption Action Plans (GAAPs). Using matching for causal inference, I find that projects with GAAPs have better project outcomes than similar projects without GAAPs. Contrary to recent claims that the only way to effectively control corruption is through collective action, the results suggest that principal-agent style monitoring  remains useful, and weak institutions also do not automatically yield poor development outcomes. International organizationsâ€™ investments in large anti-corruption infrastructures after corruption-related legitimacy crises and bureaucrats' anti-corruption expertise are the primary drivers of the results.
