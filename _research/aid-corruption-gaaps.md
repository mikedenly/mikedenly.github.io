<p style="font-size: 12pt; width: 100%; text-align: left;">Can foreign aid succeed in countries with weak institutions? Although institutional challenges to aid effectiveness are significant, I argue that the increased legitimacy costs of corruption-related aid failures changed agencies' strategic calculus and, in turn, the potential for aid succeed in weak institutional environments. However, aid agenciesâ€™ large recent investments in anti-corruption infrastructures and increasing knowledge about what works in anti-corruption are insufficient on their own. For aid to succeed in weak institutional environments, bureaucrats must design targeted, project-level countermeasures that focus bureaucratic attention and effort. To test the hypothesis, I individually coded all 3,663 World Bank investment projects approved from 2001-2016 for their use of context-specific, project-level Governance and Anti-Corruption Action Plans (GAAPs). Using frontier matching for causal inference, I find that projects with GAAPs have better project outcomes than similar projects without GAAPs. Contrary to recent claims that the only way to effectively control corruption is through collective action, the results suggest that principal-agent style monitoring remains useful, and weak institutions also do not automatically yield poor development outcomes.
