<p style="font-size: 12pt; width: 100%; text-align: left;">Can foreign aid succeed in countries with weak institutions? Conventional wisdom suggests that it cannot because institutional problems are intractable, aid is fungible, and most aid is political and thus inefficient. To provide evidence to the contrary, I individually coded all 3,437 World Bank investment projects approved from fiscal years 2001-2014 for the use of context-specific, project-level Governance and Anti-Corruption Action Plans (GAAPs). Using matching for causal inference, I find that projects with GAAPs have better project outcomes than similar projects without GAAPs. Contrary to recent claims that the only way to effectively control corruption is through collective action, the results suggest that monitoring based on the principal-agent model remains useful, and weak institutions also do not automatically yield poor development outcomes. International organizationsâ€™ investments in large anti-corruption infrastructures and bureaucrats' development of anti-corruption expertise are the primary drivers of the results.</p>
